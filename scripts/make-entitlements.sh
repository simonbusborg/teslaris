# Write the entitlements the app and its widget are signed with.
#
# Called by the Makefile as: make-entitlements.sh <out-dir> [app-group]
#
# The App Group is what the whole widget rests on: a sandboxed .appex can
# only see what the app leaves in the shared container. On macOS the group
# identifier must carry the Team ID prefix, which is a secret in CI.
#
# A build with no Team ID can't have one: macOS validates an app group
# against the team in the signature, and an ad-hoc build has no team, so the
# container URL resolves and every read is denied — which looks exactly like
# a bug in the app. Such a build gets a sandbox exception for a plain folder
# instead, and SharedStore points both processes there.
#
# The sandbox itself stays on either way. WidgetKit will not register an
# unsandboxed extension at all: the widget simply stops appearing in the
# gallery, with nothing anywhere to say why.
